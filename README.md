> “Come and take them.” – Leonidas, Spartan King

When Xerxes demanded that the Spartans surrender their weapons, King Leonidas said "Come and take them."

This is a Visual Studio Code theme for the strong of heart.

> “He who sweats more in training bleeds less in war.”

By embracing the minimalist nature of this theme, you will become stronger. More able. More focused for your daily tasks. You'll become a Spartan.
